synopsis: "Convert Verilog to a Hardcaml design"
description: "
The opensource synthesis tool yosys is used to convert a verilog design to a JSON based
netlist representation. This library can load the JSON netlist and build a hardcaml
circuit.

Code can also be generated to wrap the conversion process using Hardcaml interfaces.
