   Multiport memories for Hardcaml
   ===============================

   The basic memory primitive provide by Hardcaml has one write (wr) and
   one read (rd) port.  The write is synchronous and the read is asynchronous.
   By adding a register to either the read address or output data we can
   generate standard read-before-write and write-before-read synchronous
   memories.  The read and write clocks can be from different domains.

   A simple way to build a multi-port memory is out of simple registers
   This is, of course, very inefficient.  One restriction that
   still exists is that each write port must be from the same clock
   domain.  I (think) the reads ports could potentially be in differing
   clock domains.

   LVT
   ===

   To do a bit better we can instead build multi-port memories using
   a Live Value Table (LVT).  The idea here is in 3 steps;

   1] To make N rd ports, we replicate a 1 rd ram N times each written
   with the same data.  Note each replicated RAM will contain exactly
   the same data.  The replication provides N access ports to this data.
   Call this memory_nrd.

   2] To make M wr ports we initially replicate memory_nrd M times.
   Each write port is connected to one memory_nrd instance.  Note that
   each memory_nrd bank will this time contain different data.
   We now have M * N ram outputs to select between to for the N read
   ports.

   3] Build the live value table.  This tracks the bank which was most
   recently written for each address in the RAM.  This is built as
   a multi-port memory itself, specifically using the simple register
   scheme described before.  The outputs of the LVT (one for each read
   port) selects the bank built in step 2 that contains the most
   recently written value for a particular address.

   Consider 2 read, 4 write ports on a 256 element x 32 bit memory.
   Using the pure register scheme we will need to generate 256x32
   register bits, write port selection logic at the input to each
   register, and 2 256x32 muxes to select the read data.

   With the LVT scheme we still need a register based multiport
   memory - in this case 2 read, 4 write ports on a 256 element x 2 bit
   memory.  Note the change here - we went from a 32 bit memory (to
   store the data) to a 2 bit memory (to store the index of the latest
   write bank ie it's of width log2(number of write ports).  In this
   case we have save approx 16x logic resources.

   Of course we also need 2*4 256 x 32 memories (with 1 read and 1 write
   port each) to store the data.
